# PlanetFall
A Lunar Lander Adventure for the Apple IIe

## PLANETFALL README

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Planet Fall is a lunar lander genre
game that was originally published for
the TI-99/4a in the book "TI-99/4A: 24
BASIC Program" (SAMS presents #22247,
ISBN 0-672-22247-7) by Carol Ann
Casciato and Donald J. Horsfall.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a largely typical example of
the 'Lunar Lander' genre, but with a
few unique features. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has random elements in the startup
parameters of any given round, and the
random selection of a "target planet"
from a list of 5 possible bodies (none
of which are the Earth's Moon).

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometime around 1984, I typed this
game in to my family's TI-99/4a home
computer which we had obtained when TI
dropped the price to a mere $49 in a
desperate bid to sell the somewhat
quirky and slow computer.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I quickly discovered it had become a
favorite of my grandfather, who was
probably entertained by the ability to
use both math and physics playing the
game.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we "upgraded" to the similarly
ill-fated Coleco Adam, I ported this
game to that system as well, and he
continued to spend hours each evening
entertaining himself. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, some 15 years after his passing
and on the eve of the launch of
Artemis-I, I have once again ported it.
This time to the Apple IIe.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have attempted to retain its
quirks, while fixing a few bugs and
adapting its graphics and sounds as
best I can to the somewhat more limited
capabilities of the Apple IIe, as the
IIe does not possess anything close to
the TMS9918 Video or TMS9919 Sound
chips used in the TI-99/4a.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still the "soul" of the game is
intact, warts and all, and maybe you
can find a bit of fun trying to land in
such exotic locales as planet CYGNUS
X-1.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Happy Craterings,
